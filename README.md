# Conversion-Of-Numbers-Into-Words

The user can input any number in the numerical form belonging to the range 0 to 99,999,999. The compiler converts that number into it's corresponding word representation. This program is implemented using the data structure stack.

This program uses 5 functions:
1) main ()
The user inputs the numerical form of the number which has to be converted. The compiler converts the number into English word form and displays it as output.
2) push ()
It checks if the user has entered a number with less than 9 digits and then it pushes or adds that number into the stack.
3) print ()
This checks which digit is in the one’s place of the number. It then converts that number into words accordingly.
4) print_pair ()
This now checks for both the digits in the one’s and ten’s place of the number. It then converts both the digits into it's word form accordingly.
5) trans ()
It checks the length of the number to be converted into words. It then goes into the stack to check the remaining digits other than the digits in the one’s and ten’s place. It converts all the remaining digits into it's word form accordingly.

The main aims of this project are:
1) This program was developed to help users with a few day to day processes, billings, etc. 
2) It also comes in handy when we have to store large amounts of numerical data.
